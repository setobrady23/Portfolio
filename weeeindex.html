            Aloha, I'm Oizys and I am a senior at Aiea High School. I am 17 years old and will be graduating in 2023. I was born and raised in Aiea, Hawaii with one older brother. I am Japanese, Chinese, and Native Hawaiian, so I have quite a big family.

        <p class="solid_left"> 
            I am quite adept in video editing. I have known how to since I was 10, but I have been doing it recreationally for almost two years with almost 500 hours. I am capable of using photoshop and illustrator programs. I have taken Hawaiian for three years and am able to write and somewhat speak in it. I have taken 4 years of Automotive Technology. I know how to read both HTML and CSS. I can type 85 words per minute or 423 characters per minute with a 99% accuracy rate.

            On weekends, I enjoy hanging out with my friends doing whatever we feel like. I love playing all kinds of video games, but my favorite is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I like watching anime, with my favorite series is Fly Me To The Moon and my favorite movie is Tale of Princess Kaguya.

        <p class="solid_left">
            I plan on going to Leeward Community College and transfer to the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I will graduate with a major in Creative Media and a minor in Hawaiian. Because my family lives here, I don't want to move. So hopefully I can find a job here and not have to move away.
